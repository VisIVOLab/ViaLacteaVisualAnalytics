The ViaLactea Visual Analytics (VLVA) tool, based on the VisIVO suite, is aimed to exploit a combination of all 
new-generation surveys of the Galactic Plane to study the star formation process of the Milky Way. 
It combines different types of visualization to perform the analysis exploring the correlation between different data, 
for example 2D intensity images with 3D molecular spectral cubes. 

The implementation philosophy behind VLVA is to make transparent to the scientist the access to all 
informations without requiring technical skills to query the data source base (namely the ViaLactea Knowledge Base).
